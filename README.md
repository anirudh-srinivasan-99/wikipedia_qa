# Wikipedia QA Bot

## Scope of the Project
1. Summarize the Wikipedia article.
2. Answer any question from the article, quoting the text within it.

Currently, we are only restricting it to the text content available in the Wikipedia article.

### SMART Goals (Can Change in Future)

### Specific
- **Summarization Goal:** Develop a system that can summarize a given Wikipedia article within 300 words while retaining key information.
- **QA Goal:** Implement a system that can accurately answer at least 90% of user-generated questions related to the Wikipedia article, quoting the relevant text directly from the article.

### Measurable
- **Summarization:** Ensure the summarization output is no longer than 300 words and covers at least 95% of the key points from the article.
- **QA:** Achieve a precision and recall rate of 90% or higher in the QA system's responses, with accuracy verified against a set of benchmark questions.

### Achievable
- **Summarization:** Utilize existing LLMs and summarization algorithms to train the model to generate concise summaries.
- **QA:** Leverage pre-trained LLMs and fine-tune them for extracting and quoting relevant text for answering questions.

### Relevant
- This project directly enhances understanding and application of LLMs in real-world tasks, providing hands-on experience in text summarization and QA systems.

### Time-bound
- **Summarization:** Complete the development and testing of the summarization module within 4 weeks.
- **QA:** Finish the implementation and validation of the QA module within 8 weeks, including an additional 2 weeks for integration and final testing.

## Task List
1. Definition of the Problem Statement
2. Research into LLMs for summarization and QA
3. Compare and contrast on the shortlisted LLMs
4. Create a preprocessing pipeline to clean wikipedia articles
5. Create a module that takes in wikipedia article and is able to summarize
6. Create a module that is able to answer question based on the wikipedia article
7. Integrate the modules into a single solution
8. Add User Interface and Host the solution
9. Document along the way
